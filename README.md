# Event_Management_System
This Employee Management System is a full-stack web application designed to manage employee information. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee data. The system is built using Spring Boot for the backend, MySQL for the database, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend.


# Features

- **Add Employee**: Ability to add a new employee to the system with details such as name, email, phone number, and department.
- **View Employees**: View a list of all employees stored in the database.
- **Edit Employee**: Edit the details of an existing employee.
- **Delete Employee**: Delete an employee from the system.
- **Search Employees**: Search for employees by name or department.
- **Validation**: Ensure that the name, email, phone, and department fields are valid before submitting data.

# Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL
- **API**: RESTful APIs for CRUD operations
- **Validation**: Ensures that all employee data is valid before being saved to the database.

# How to Run the Project

# Backend
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse,STS).
3. Make sure to configure your database credentials in `application.properties` (e.g., MySQL ).
4. Run the Spring Boot application (`EmployeeManagementApplication.java`).
5. The backend will be available at `http://localhost:9090`.

# Frontend
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The frontend will make requests to the backend (running on `localhost:9090`), so ensure that the backend is running before using the frontend.
